### Dependencies
This program was written in python3, the libraries used are pandas,numpy, and random


### Usage
1) clone the script
2) using the terminal, go into the directory containing this script
3) run the program from the terminal

### code explained:
This program is a text based game. You start by choosing a company listed in the csv file. The company has properties such as the headquarters, sectory, and of course companyname. The computer repeatidley will ask yes or no questions until it is able to guess the company you were thinking of. 

Here's a step-by-step guideline which shows how the code was created:

To start we import needed modules, then load in our csv file and make it a DataFrame using pandas
```python
#import needed modules
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random

#load the csv file and convert it to a DataFrame
file_name = "global_500_companies.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_name)Â¸
```
Some additional set-up is needed in terms of creating a list of keys, and a boolean to control loop breaking

```python
#make a list of keys for the DataFrame
keys = ["Sector","HQLocation","CompanyName"]

#bool that can break out of the main loop
break_bool = False
```
Here's the bones of the program

```python
def filter_by_key(dataf,key):
    key_list = dataf[key].tolist()
    choice = random.choice(key_list)
    question = "is it {}?".format(choice)
    user_input = input(question)

    if(user_input == "n" or user_input == "no"):
        dataf = dataf[(dataf[key] != choice)]
    elif(user_input == "y" or user_input == "yes"):
        if key == "CompanyName":
            dataf = dataf[(dataf[key] == choice)]
            global break_bool
            break_bool = True
        elif(len(keys) > 1):
            keys.remove(key)
            dataf = dataf[(dataf[key] == choice)]

        # elif len(keys) == 1:
        #     #global break_bool
        #     break_bool = True

    return dataf
```
